## Background

recursive_ct_converter.py iterates through the data folder and generates a folder of .stl files.

convert_stl_to_obj.py iterates through the results of recursive_ct_converter, and generates .obj files.

## Usage:

clone this repository. Create a "data" folder:

```bash
mkdir data
```

Place all dicom files in this folder.

NOTE: all dicom files for a patient should be placed in their own individual folder.

Run the converter on the data:

```bash
python recursive_ct_converter.py
```

This will take some time. 

After it is complete, run the obj converter:

```bash
python convert_stl_to_obj.py
```

The results will save to a "ResultsObj" folder:
